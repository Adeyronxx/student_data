 # SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

We received a student data containing information regarding students from various schools(both charter and public), their math and reading scores as well as the budget allocated to the school. Using descriptive statistics on the data as a whole we were able to ascertain that the average math score was 64.7%. Drilling down further into the data we discovered that Charter Schools averaged better than Public Schools in both reading and math (a wider margin in math when compared to reading) and we were also able to dertermine that public school had a larger school budget than charter schools. Hence, there is a positive relationship between the school budget and how well the student's perform.
